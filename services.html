            <p class="par"> Computer programmers create instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully. Computer programmers use specialized languages to communicate with computers, applications and other systems to get computers and computer networks to perform a set of specific tasks. Languages like C++, Java, Python and more allow programmers – often working closely with software developers and engineers to build programs that allow “search, surfing and selfies,” according to ComputerScience.org.

                There are many programming languages but some have emerged as the most popular. CareerKarma listed the most common programming languages in 2021 based on job openings.
                
                Some of the common tasks a computer programmer is required to master were compiled by O*Net online and include:
                
                Testing software performance.
                Resolving computer software problems.
                Modifying software programs to improve performance.
                Writing computer programming code.
                Collaborating with others to resolve information technology issues. Most computer programming positions require at least a bachelor's degree, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and many advanced degree programs are also available. In addition to those academic avenues, there are dozens of professional and nonprofit professional certifications available. BLS notes that certifications exist for specific programming languages and that some employers may require programmers to become certified in the products the company uses.

                Some of the professional certifications available include:
                
                CISCO – Certified Network Associate, Certified Network Profession Routing and Switching, Certified Network Associate Security Credential
                Microsoft – Certified Solution Developer for Web Applications, Certified Solutions Associate Windows Server
                Professional Associations – Software Development Associate Certification, Comptia’s Security+, Comptia’s A+ Certification, Comptia’s Linux+
                Nonprofit – Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Certified Information Security Manager, Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional Credential
